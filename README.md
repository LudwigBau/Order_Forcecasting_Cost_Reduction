# Order Forecasting and Cost Reduction

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "Enhancing E-Commerce Fulfillment Operations: Machine Learning Approaches for Order Forecasting and Cost Reduction", currently under development by Ludwig Baunach and co-author Stefan Spinler.

**Note** Unfortunately, we are not able to share our data due to a NDA 

## How to Navigate and Use the Code

**Main Folder**: This is where all the primary scripts are located. If you're looking to understand the flow of the code, this is a good place to start.

**Running the Code**: Begin by running `main_data_prep.py` to pre-process the data. After this step, run `main_forecasting.py` to execute the forecasting models, create ensembles, and run the workforce optimization.

**Code Structure**: The repository is organized into several folders, each serving a specific purpose:
   - `data_prep` contains scripts for data wrangling and preparation.
   - `model` houses the code for the forecasting models.
   - `evaluation` includes scripts for evaluating the performance of the models.
   - `Simulation` contains scripts for workforce scheduling simulation.
   
**Utilities**: The `utils` folder contains custom functions that are utilized by the main scripts.

## Requirements

The code is still under development. As soon as the paper is accepted by a journal we will add example data and requirements.txt
