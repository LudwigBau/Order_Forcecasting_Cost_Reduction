# Description:

# There are several sections to be addressed:

# Simulating Scenarios:
# Create artificial actual values based on best fit distribution in a given week
# Create artificial forecasts based on error distribution in a given week

# First Stage Optimisation:
# Schedule planned workforce based on expected demand (forecast)
# Calculate demanded work in hours
# Fit number of workers on hours

# Second Stage Optimisation:
# Three options:
# 1. no change, planned workforce can tackle the demand
# 2. overtime, planned workforce use
# 3. extra workers, if overtime is not sufficient to fill todays demand, then add extra workforce for tomorrow's shift.

# Problem Description:

# I have six days of forecast.
# I plan my workforce based on the forecast
# Each day I get to know the actual demand and can adapt my workforce by overtime or extra workers on the next day to
# fill a service level of psi %


# Workflow:

# 1. Simulate (5600 scenarios per week per method) based on data
# 2. Multistage optimisation minimising labour cost
# 3. Save Results
