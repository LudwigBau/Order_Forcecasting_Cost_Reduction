# Description:

# Write down steps to take to model the workforce model from "Enhancing fulfilment operation using ml"
# There are several sections to be addressed:

# Simulating Scenarios:
# Create artificial actual values based on distribution in a given week
# Create artificial forecasts based on error distribution in a given week

# First Stage Optimisation:
# Schedule planned workforce based on expected demand (forecast)
# Calculate demanded work in hours
# Fit number of workers on hours (per worker 10h)

# Second Stage Optimisation:
# Three options:
# 1. no change, planned workforce can tackle the demand
# 2. overtime, planned workforce use
# 3. extra workers, if overtime is not sufficient to fill todays demand, it exceeds tomorrow's overtime capacity
#                   then add extra workforce for tomorrow's shift.
# Test for different service levels. fill rate of 85, 90, 95 %

# Problem Description:

# I have six days of forecast.
# I plan my workforce based on the forecast
# Each day I get to know the actual demand and can adapt my workforce by overtime or extra workers on the next day to
# fill a service level of X %


# Workflow:
# Use functional programming paradigm:

# 1. Simulate (2800 scenarios per week per method) based on data
# 2. Multistep multistage optimisation
# 3. Save Results (nr. planned workers, nr. extra workers, total cost)
# 4. Analyse distribution of the three variables
# 5. Compare average cost per method.


# How To Optimise using Gurobi:

# Define decision variable
# Define constants
# Define First Stage Objective Function
# Define Constraints of first obj. function
# Define Second Stage Objective Function
# Define Constraints of second obj. function
# Save and analyse results

# Import libraries:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
